# FashionMNIST_ANN

## Objective
The goal is to build a multiclass classification model using Keras with TensorFlow backend to classify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model aims to achieve an accuracy of at least 90% on the test set.

## Description of the Fashion MNIST Dataset
Fashion MNIST consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, divided into 10 different fashion categories. The dataset includes:
- 60,000 images for training
- 10,000 images for testing

Each image belongs to one of the following 10 classes:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## Instructions for Running the Code in Jupyter Notebook
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-mnist-classification.git
    cd fashion-mnist-classification
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. **Open the notebook**:
    - Open `fashion_mnist_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
    - Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, create and train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Dependencies and Installation Instructions
